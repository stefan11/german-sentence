These files are version controled. The URL for the project is 

svn+ssh://home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de/home/stefan/.svn-books/German-sentence

If you configured ssh correctly (key authorization), you do not need a login name and a password.

For Mac OS I tested version.app as a SVN client. 

http://versionsapp.com/

It works.

If you do not want to see the auxiliary files that are produced by LaTeX (and some other files), you can add the following line to the file ~/.subversion/config

global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la #*# .*.rej *.rej .*~ *~ .#* .DS_Store *.sav *.bak .alec_throw .trale_user_cmd* *.old *.toc *.aux *.snm *.blg *.dvi *.nav *.ps *.pdf *.log .trale_interface* CVS* *.adx *.adx.hyp *.and *.ilg *.out *.idx *.ind *.*pk *.ldx *.lnd *.cut 




The styles are part of the repository. You have to set up your tex system in a way that these styles
and headers are found before other styles with the same name that maybe installed on your system.

When you look at the LaTeX ouput you should see something like:

(./styles/jambox.sty
\jamwidth=\dimen106
) (./styles/article-ex.sty
\c@smtempcnt=\count94
\widelabel=\dimen107
) (./styles/makros.2e.sty
(./styles/merkmalstruktur.sty

For the tcsh you can put the following into .cshrc:

setenv TEXINPUTS .:./styles//:

 
You may check the effectiveness of your settings by typing:

tlmgr conf



Details regarding SVN:

The svn repository is located on home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de you have to login there with the user name
that Stefan told you. In order to do this automatically you have to modify your ~/.ssh/config (on
Linux and Mac) to include the following:

Host home home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de
    HostName home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de
    User your-user-name


You can then type:

svn checkout svn+ssh://home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de/home/stefan/.svn-books/German-sentence 




I used the following:


ssh home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de svnadmin create /home/stefan/.svn-books/German-sentence


svn import -m "" German-sentence svn+ssh://home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de/home/stefan/.svn-books/German-sentence

svn checkout svn+ssh://home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de/home/stefan/.svn-books/German-sentence 


svn propedit svn:externals .
styles svn+ssh://home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de/home/stefan/.svn-books/styles
Bibliography svn+ssh://home.hpsg.fu-berlin.de/home/stefan/.svn-books/Bibliography


For a quickcheck do "make check" or even quicker: latex check-danish ; dvips check-danish ; bibtex check-danish.aux


Or if you prefer to look at two pages simultanously:
 
latex check-danish ; make check-danish.2.ps ; bibtex check-danish.aux
